HOW TO GET MINIMUM CUT EDGES: DO THE FOLLOWING:

1) Run Ford-Fulkerson algorithm and consider the final residual graph.

2) Find the set of vertices that are reachable from the source in the residual graph.

3) All edges which are from a reachable vertex to non-reachable vertex are minimum cut edges. Print all such edges.


# Python program for finding min-cut in the given graph 
# Complexity : (E*(V^3)) 
# Total augmenting path = VE and BFS with adj matrix takes :V^2 times
